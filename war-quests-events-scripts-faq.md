# Wars, Quests, Events, and Scripts FAQ
<details>
    <summary><b>What is a War?</b></summary>
You can think of a war as a container for the various quests in game. The <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/100" title="Fuyuki Singularity">Fuyuki Singularity</a></b>, <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/301" title="Lostbelt 1">Lostbelt 1</a></b>, the map for <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/8290" title="Battle in New York">Battle in New York</a></b>, and even the lists of <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/1002" title="Daily Quests">Daily Quests</a></b> or <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/1003" title="Interludes">Interludes</a></b> that you see on the main page of FGO are wars. It is important to note that wars are distinct from events, which have their own page on the Atlas Academy DB. While an event may have a war attached to it, such as GudaGuda, the event itself is not a war, nor do all events have wars. A half AP event in FGO, for example, does not have a war attached. See the event section for more details on events.

  <summary><b>Breakdown of the War Page</b></summary>
An example war to look at is <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/100" title="Singularity F: Flame Contaminated City: Fuyuki">Singularity F: Flame Contaminated City: Fuyuki</a></b>. You'll see that the page is broken into several sections.

The first section, as represented below, includes general information about the war, including:
 - **Name**
 - **Age** (time of the war in game, such as 2004 for Fuyuki)
 - **Event** that the war is tied to (if any)
 - **Opening Scripts** (story sequences that appear when first opening the war)
 - **Banner** (the war's icon on your terminal)
 - **BGM** (the war's main background music)

You will also see buttons for the raw data of the war itself that is used to render the page, either in Nice or Raw format.

Beneath the war's general information you will find the main quests associated with the war, if any. 
Each quest will tell you the following information:
  - **Section** (chapter in game)
  - **ID**
  - **Name**
  - **Spot** (node, or location on a map in game)
  - **Phases** (the different arrows or parts to a quest, such as 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 etc.) 
  - **Completion Reward** (if applicable)
  - **Scripts** (any story sections that the quest has)
  
Clicking on the quest's ID or name will take you to that quest's page, and clicking on any individual phase will take you directly to that phase of the quest. A dragon symbol by a phase indicates it has enemies; a book symbol indicates it is story only.

Beneath the main quests you will find, if applicable, **free quests**, **interludes**, **event quests**, or any other type of available quests, each sorted into its own dropdown. Within each dropdown, the quests are ordered within their respective nodes, then by quest ID.

  <summary><b>What is a Quest?</b></summary>
Quests are the individual containers for dialogue or battle sequences in FGO. When you click on a map location within a singularity or event, the options that you have, be it the next part of the story, a free quest, or an interlude, are quests.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Breakdown of the Quest Page</b></summary>
  
An example quest to look at is <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/quest/1000001/1" title="Burning City">Burning City</a></b>. You'll see that like the war page, it is broken into several sections. The first section, as represented below, includes general information about the quest, including, among other things:
 - **Type** (free quest, main quest, interlude etc.)
 - **Cost** (AP or any other currency required to complete the quest)
 - **Rewards** for completing the quest (if applicable)
 - **Opening** and **Closing** times (in your local time)
 - **Individuality** (whether it is a sun field, city field, a specific event field, etc.)


Many quests have multiple phases, or parts to the quest. These are seen as 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc. in game, with each piece being its own phase. For quests with multiple phases, you can navigate between them using the arrows or numbers in the **Phases** row.
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56235026/138540802-43b9a15a-d17b-4788-abae-43cae51d0bf4.png)

  
Beneath the general information, you will see a list of the scripts for the phase you are on (if any), as well as any pre-battle messages and drop data if available. Mouse over the "i" to see a tooltip indicating how many runs the drop data is based on. The more runs worth of data, the more accurate it is.

Finally, below the drop data you will see a list of stages, or battle waves, as well as the enemies within them if available. Please note that enemy data is not available for all quests. The enemy data includes a list of the drops of each particular mob if available, as well as all the general information regarding each enemy, including their, among other things: 
- **Stats** (such as HP, NP bars, death rate, etc.)
- **Skills**
- **Traits**
- **AI** (used to determine how enemies will act in battle)

You may also see a **Field AI** before the enemies. This refers to effects tied to the field itself rather than any individual enemy.

  <summary><b>Where can I find Hunting Quests / Trial Quests?</b></summary>
Hunting and Trial quests can be found in <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/9999" title="War 9999: Chaldea Gate">War 9999: Chaldea Gate</a></b>.
</details>


<details>
  <summary><b>What is an Event / How are Events and Wars Different?</b></summary>
As noted in the Wars section, Events and Wars, while sometimes sounding similar, are very different things. If one thinks of Saber Wars for an example, there are 
two separate components: the <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/NA/war/8095" title="War">War</a></b>, or the actual Saber Wars map with nodes and quests on it, and the <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/NA/event/80008" title="Event">Event</a></b> behind it. The event is where you can find information like the lottery, point ladder, or shop tied to an in-game event. Note that some events may not have these, such as a 1/2 AP or bonus FP event.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Breakdown of the Events Page</b></summary>
  
Like the other pages, the Event page is broken down into sections. The top section provides general information about the event, including:
- **ID**
- **Name**
- **Wars** (any Wars tied to the event)
- **Status** (whether the event is ongoing or not)
- **Start** and **End** times (in your local time)
  
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56235026/138547602-9ad456a9-34d9-4df3-97ab-c9c63bf7bcab.png)
  
Beneath the general information will be any point ladders, shops, or lotteries if applicable. For shops in particular, you are able to utilize the planner to calculate the amount of event currency you will need for what you want. To enable the planner feature, click the green edit button on the right side of the currency bar, pictured below:
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56235026/138547444-9b1d89eb-bd0d-4bd3-900e-afcd36ab1b2f.png)
  
Once you have enabled planner mode, you have several options. You can utilize the **Quick Toggles** in order to instantly select or deselect all items, and you can also filter out commonly excluded items from the calculated totals, such as gems, monuments, or pieces. In addition to the Quick Toggles, you can also individually select items that you want. The two rightmost columns for each item are **Limit** and **Target**. Limit refers to the maximum amount of an item that can be purchased, while Target allows you to indicate how many of that item you wish to purchase. For each item you set with Target, the total cost of that item is added to the cost bar above the shop. In the image below, you will see that two "Purely Bloom" craft essences which cost 150 Vacuum Tubes each have been selected via the Target column, and the total cost of 300 Vacuum Tubes is represented in the cost bar.

  <summary><b>How Can I Find Story Text?</b></summary>
  
Story text on the Atlas Academy DB is known as a **Script**. There are several ways you can find a particular quest's script on the DB.
  
<details>
  
<summary><b>Method 1) Script Search</b></summary>
  
You can find the <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/NA/scripts" title="Script Search">Script Search</a></b> page from the "Search" dropdown in the navigation bar at the top of the DB page.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56235026/138543101-982c6cc5-d4b7-4ca3-b7eb-8ca4f7eb3d9e.png)
This page allows you to search through the contents of all the scripts in the game to find the one you are looking for. Make sure to pay attention to the search syntax 
listed on the page to refine your searches.
**Please keep in mind which region you are using the script page on. You cannot search a script using English on the JP page and vice versa.**
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Method 2) Via the Wars Page</b></summary>
  
If you don't remember exactly what was said in the script in question to find it via search, but you do remember the singularity or event it was in, you can navigate to the 
<b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/wars" title="Wars">Wars</a></b> page on the navigation bar, and select the war in question. There, on the rightmost side of each quest, you will see the scripts that quest has available, and can select the one you want. They are sorted into phases, so if the list says **1: 10, 11**, then you know those two scripts come from phase 1 of the quest. For more details about when the scripts appear in the quest, you can go to the quest's page.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Method 3) Via the Quests Page</b></summary>
  
If you know what quest your script comes from, you can either utilize the <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/NA/quests" title="Quest Search">Quest Search</a></b>, or utilize the 
  <b><a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/wars" title="Wars">Wars</a></b> page to navigate to the quest you have in mind. There, for each phase of the quest, you can see which scripts are 
available and when they play in the quest beneath the general quest information. Use the phase row to navigate between phases.
