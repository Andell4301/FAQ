# Wars, Quests, and Scripts FAQ
<details>
  <summary><b>What is a War?</b></summary>
You can think of a war as a container for the various quests in game. The <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/100" title="Fuyuki Singularity">Fuyuki Singularity</a>, <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/301" title="Lostbelt 1">Lostbelt 1</a>, the map for <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/8290" title="Battle in New York">Battle in New York</a>, and even the lists of <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/1002" title="Daily Quests">Daily Quests</a> or <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/1003" title="Interludes">Interludes</a> that you see on the main page of FGO are wars. It is important to note that wars are distinct from events, which have their own page on the Atlas Academy DB. While an event may have a war attached to it, such as GudaGuda, the event itself is not a war, nor do all events have wars. A half AP event in FGO, for example, does not have a war attached.

  <summary><b>Breakdown of the War Page</b></summary>
An example war to look at is <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/war/100" title="Singularity F: Flame Contaminated City: Fuyuki">Singularity F: Flame Contaminated City: Fuyuki</a>. You'll see that the page is broken into several sections.

The first section, as represented below, includes general information about the war, such as its **Name**, **Age** (the time of the singularity in game, such as 2004 for Fuyuki), the **Event** the war is tied to (if any), any **Opening Scripts** (dialogue sequences) that appear upon opening the singularity, the war's icon in your terminal (**Banner**), 
and its background **Music**. You will also see buttons for the war's data itself, either in Nice or Raw format.

Beneath the war's general information you will find the main quests associated with the war, if any. 
Each quest will tell you its **Section**, which is the chapter in game, **ID**, **Name**, **Spot** (its Node or Map Location), **Phases** (the arrows on the quest), 
**Completion Reward** if there is one, and finally **Scripts**, or any dialogue sections the quest has. Clicking on the quest's ID or name will take you to that quest's page, and clicking on any individual phases will take you directly to that phase of the quest. If a phase has a dragon symbol, tha phase has enemie. A book symbol indicates a 
dialogue only phase.

Beneath the main quests you will find, if applicable, free quests, interludes, event quests, or any other type of available quests, each sorted into its own dropdown. Within each dropdown, the quests are ordered within their respective nodes, then by quest ID.

  <summary><b>What is a Quest?</b></summary>
Quests are the individual containers for dialogue or battle sequences in FGO. When you click on a map location within a singularity or event, the options that you have, be it 
the next part of the story, a free quest, or an interlude, are quests.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Breakdown of the Quest Page</b></summary>
  
An example quest to look at is <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/quest/1000001/1" title="Burning City">Burning City</a>. You'll see that like the war page, it is broken into several sections.
The first section, as represented below, includes general information about the quest, including the **Type** of quest (such as Free or Main), the **Cost** to complete it, 
the **Rewards** it gives, when it **Opens** or **Closes**, among other things. For a quest with multiple phases, the **Phases** row beneath the quest's ID allows you to 
navigate to other phases.

Beneath the general information, you will see a list of the scripts for the phase you are on if any, as well as any pre-battle messages and drop data if available. Mouse over 
the i to see a tooltip indicating how many runs the drop data is based on. The more runs worth of data, the more accurate it is.

Finally, below the drop data you will see a list of stages, or battle waves, as well as the enemies within them, if available. Please note that enemy data is not available 
for all quests. The enemy data includes a list of the drops of each particular mob if available, as well as all the general information regarding each enemy, including their 
**Stats**, **Skills**, **Traits**, **AI** and more.

  <summary><b>How Can I Find Story Text?</b></summary>
  
Story text on the Atlas Academy DB is known as a **Script**. There are several ways you can find a particular quest's script on the DB.
  
<details>
  
<summary><b>Method 1) Script Search</b></summary>
  
You can find the <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/NA/scripts" title="Script Search">Script Search</a> page from the "Search" dropdown in the navigation bar at the top of the DB page.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56235026/138543101-982c6cc5-d4b7-4ca3-b7eb-8ca4f7eb3d9e.png)
This page allows you to search through the contents of all the scripts in the game to find the one you are looking for. Make sure to pay attention to the search syntax 
listed on the page to refine your searches.
**Note: Make sure you are using the proper region. You cannot search a script using Enlgish on the JP page and vice versa.**
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Method 2) Via the Wars Page</b></summary>
  
If you don't remember exactly what was said in the script in question to find it via search, but you do remember the singularity or event it was in, you can navigate to the 
<a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/wars" title="Wars">Wars</a> page on the navigation bar, and select the war in question. There, on the rightmost side of each quest, you will see the scripts that quest has available, and can select the one you want. They are sorted into phases, so if the list says **1: 10, 11**, then you know those two scripts come from phase 1 of the quest. For more details about when the scripts appear in the quest, you can go to the quest's page.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Method 3) Via the Quests Page</b></summary>
  
If you know what quest your script comes from, you can either utilize the <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/NA/quests" title="Quest Search">Quest Search</a>, or utilize the 
  <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/JP/wars" title="Wars">Wars</a> page to navigate to the quest you have in mind. There, for each phase of the quest, you can see which scripts are 
available and when they play in the quest beneath the general quest information. Use the phase row to navigate between phases.

  <summary><b>Where can I find Hunting Quests / Trial Quests?</b></summary>
